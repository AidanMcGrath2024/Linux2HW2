If a robot which had completed its task is immediately assigned a new task, it may occupy its tools indefinitely. If the robot "hogged" the tools, then the other robots wouldn't ever have access to the tools to complete their tasks. 

In this situation, the robots would be held in a deadlock. Three robots would be stuck waiting for the two robots to finish their tasks (which are "indefinite"), and the two robots would continue completing their tasks - occupying 4/5 tools.
