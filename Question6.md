There is a risk of a race condition, which is when the ATC sleeps while a pilot is trying to check how many aircraft there are in the traffic pattern.
This can happen because all actions take a certain amount of time.
Specifically the following:
  Multiple pilots can attempt to wake up the ATC at the same time. Proper synchronization is required to ensure only one pilot establishes communication.
  If multiple pilots check if the traffic pattern is full at the same time and then decide to enter, the count might exceed the maximum allowed.
  Conflicts can arise if multiple pilots attempt to land on the single runway simultaneously. Proper locking is needed to ensure only one pilot lands at a time.
All solutions for combating race conditions require a mutex, which ensures that only one factor can change at a time.
